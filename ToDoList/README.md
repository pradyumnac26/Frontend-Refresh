# Todo List

Build a Todo List component where users can:

- Add a new todo item.
- Mark a todo as completed.
- Delete a todo item.
- View the list of all todos.

---

## Requirements

- The component should maintain a list of todos in its state.
- A todo has: `id`, `text`, and `completed` (boolean).
- An input box with placeholder `"Enter todo"` to type a new todo.
- A button labelled `"Add"` to add a todo.
- Each todo should display its text and a checkbox to toggle completion.
- Each todo should have a delete button labelled `"Delete"` to delete a todo.
- Completed todos should appear with a strikethrough style.

---

## Constraints & Edge Cases

- Todo text should not be empty.
- Case-insensitive duplicate entries should be allowed.
- Deleting an item should not affect the remaining list.
- All operations should update the UI immediately.
